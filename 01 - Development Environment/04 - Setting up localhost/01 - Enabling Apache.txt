To start apache:
$ sudo apachectl start

This will give you a basic Apache server with a DocumentRoot at /Library/WebServer/Documents/

You can enable things like PHP and virtualhosts by making use of the configuration file, which must be edited as root:
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf

Restart the apache server (like after editing the config file) with:
$ sudo apachectl graceful

Stop the Apache server:
$ sudo apachectl graceful-stop
