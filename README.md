## What is this?

This is a personal guide on installing a Mac, from zero. Mostly the things that you usually don't commit to memory.

## What for?

I usually re-install my operating systems a lot, over a course of 3 to 4 years I re-installed Windows XP and Windows 7 at least 30 times, so I learned to do these guides.

## Notes

Files that have a star (`*`) after the number are optional, you don't have to really do it.

Also, files that have a `&` after their name means that it's deprecated, and it's not gonna get maintained, until I come back to it, or find that I need it again.

If it's got both, then it is obviously optional *and* deprecated.
