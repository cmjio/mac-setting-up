## What is this?

This is a personal guide on installing a Mac, from zero. Mostly the things that you usually don't commit to memory.

## What for?

I usually re-install my operating systems a lot, over a course of 3 to 4 years I re-installed Windows XP and Windows 7 at least 30 times, so I learned to do these guides.

## Note

Files that have a star (*) after the number are optional, you don't have to really do it.
