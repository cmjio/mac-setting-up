# Installing Homebrew

## Obtaining Xcode Command Line Tools

Go to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and download the Command Line Tools. Once downloaded, install them.

Also remember to download the full Xcode, as some do require it: [Apple > iTunes > AppStore > Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)

Remember to open Xcode and allow it to install itself, otherwise you will get an error regarding it's license.

## Installing Homebrew

Simply run the following command in the Terminal application:<br />
`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"`

After that does what it should, simply run the following command:<br />
`brew doctor`

And fix any problems it shows, if it shows any.

Now you can install whatever you want.
